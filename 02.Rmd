Our models are based on Box-Jenkins method[@noauthor_boxjenkins_2016] which is pioneer in analysing time-series data

Let me give you some of the simplified analytics that runs under the hood. 

Gather stock price for a company over the period of say couple of decades and calculate
1. Average stock price durng each time slice of the day (9:30 am to 4pm split into 30 mins interval slices) vs  day average  
This metric when analysed over period of time can generally show if specific stock show tendency to open high/low and then stay flat or taper down during the day  
Usually this kind of behavior is shown by stocks affected by their offshore activities where the breaking news arrives before US wakes up so stock usually fluctuates early in the morning.

2. Average stock price durng each time slice of the Month vs Montly average  
There are multiple ways in which we slice a month. One way is to slice a month weekly. This metric show if a perticular stock moves during partcular week of the month.
Usually a stock having lot of derivative position fluctuates more in last week of the month when derivatives settlement happen. So this metric is useful in such stocks.

3. Average stock price durng each time slice of year vs Yearly average
Again here there are multiple ways you can slice up a year.
Most popular slice is a quarter, where lot of stocks show tendancy to be price high on a particular quarter of every year.
Some consumer product and ecommerce stocks show high prices after year end shopping spree. So this is another slice of the year that gives more insight to our users.

4. Average stock price just before presidential election vs 1 year after election
This is usually inetersting metric and we can typically see that if one candidate is overwhelming leading the presidential race then stock market is relatively calm but if there is uncertainty then our metrics can definitely help you calm down by guessing how market might behave during presidential election.

There are some of the very basic and most popular metrics. 
Then there are more complex and propritery metrics that combine multiple factors by weiging more than one parameter and connecting the events to predict more accurate stock price moves.

To give you an example of one of our interesting findings is if ecommerce stock prices do well post christmas then they also prerform better relative to market around coming valentine's day. We have a theory on why this happens but we will let you guess :)
