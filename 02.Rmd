## What do we mean by this

May be there is some relation between market turning favouravle during particular time frame. Time can be looked at from different granualirities e.g. time in a day a trade was booked to see if say afternoon deals are less profitable vs morning deals? or may be if we look at yearly time and try to figure out if any particular month favours the trade prifitability?

## How we would do it

Gather market fluctioations data for may be 30 years and aalyse over different time scales
1. time of a day vs daily average
2. time of month vs monthly avg
3. time of year vs yearly avg
4. just before presidential election vs 1 year after election
