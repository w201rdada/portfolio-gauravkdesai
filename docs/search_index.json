My first big idea is to deconstruct the parameters which indicate when an country is moving towards a warzone and try and predict for any given time which areas in the world are prone to war. Abstract of StockTrend Lets analyze our beloved stock market by looking at stock prices through different Time Slices’ length. My second big idea is about an analytical tool that dissects stock price from decades of price movement and generates patterns across various time slices to help customers make better financial decisions.

["WarZone-Predictor.html", "1 WarZone Predictor: Predict Next War Zone 1.1 Who would want to predict the next War Zone 1.2 How can we predict next War Zone 1.3 Conclusion", " 1 WarZone Predictor: Predict Next War Zone Keywords WarZone, UN, Peace, 1.1 Who would want to predict the next War Zone History of human kind is filled with wars that have grown from mere fights between two Homo sapiens groups to full-blown multi nation world wars. Each year billions of dollars are spent on maintaining peace and keeping the borders safe. Global bodies like United Nations were formed to maintain international peace. Hence it is necessity to study the historical war zones and try to predict the future so that we can be well prepared and we can diffuse a potential war even before it starts. This insight would certainly help countries to plan their defense budgets, strategies and even choice of ally wisely e.g. by going heavy on defence budget if one of the neighbors is trending towards war. It will also help organizations like UN to work effectively due to it’s ability to intervene in a war prone situation even before material damage is done. And taking into considration the multi pronged economic impact of war(“Economic Impact of War - Economics Help” 2018), the war predictions will help Multi National corporates to strategies expansion or oher business decisions across the border by carefully avoiding war prone areas. 1.2 How can we predict next War Zone We source the war and conflict details for past few centuries. We will attribute the war with details such as number of countries that participated, cost of war, human loss, material loss and duration of war. Then for same time period we will gather various parameters for each of the countries whether that country was at war or at peace- Economic attributes: - GDP - Debt - FX - export/import of each country - gun/weapon imports into the country Government attributes: - Local government stability/popularity/majority - Whether government is democratic or autocratic - Government’s military spends Demographic attributes: - Population, crime rates - Ethnic and religious distribution - Transparency index Geographical attributes: - Whether it is costal or enclave - Number of direct neighbor countries - Difficulty of terrain Regional unrest history: - Whether that country/region is known for unrest and wars. Now that we have all the required data within acceptable quality range lets look at some interesting findings If we plot scatterplot matrix for following 3 attributes export/import ratio is less than 5% =&gt; imports are 20 times the exports indicating highly dependent country economy Debt/GDP ration is more than 400% =&gt; super leveraged country (Dorfman 2018) Government popularity is greater than 80% =&gt; Government is capable of taking radical decisions. May be the government became popular by promising some radical action.And that radical action could lead to war. Then 70% of the time the country went into war in next 3 years. Now this is very interesting. High import and debt rations indicate that country is going through economic crisis with no recovery in sight. Which might have resulted in anti incumbency and elected a raw aggressive populist government which wants to break the shackles. The road often used to beak free is a war. If we look at histogram of single parameter “number of countries surrounding a country” then the pattern is like a bell curve. Which implies that having very few (0 or 1) or very high (&gt;7) number of neighbors actually lowers the conflict potential of a country. Having no neighbors is quite obvious conflict buster but having more than 7 neighbors might imply that there is more than one bully in vicinity and probably they are busy showing muscles to each other. Another interesting fact is the war rate has sharply decreased from 1950s. Though we expected formation of UN in 1942 would have caused this, but if we drill down then it appears that first use of atom bomb in 1945 has actually reduced the open wars across the region. Same pattern can be seen in Indian sub-continent where post nuclear tests in 1998 there is no war reported. So the data suggests that nuclear weapons have actually reduced the open wars. 1.3 Conclusion The study gives us useful insight that we can predict whether a country is heading towards a war with some degree of confidence. These findings can be used by organizations like UN to run their programs more effectively and possibly prevent a war in making. It can also be used by MNCs to direct their business strategies. A word of caution is this insight can also be misused to push a country into a war by fuelling the reasons of conflicts which otherwise would have been hidden from the external world. And finally we should also understand that what we are predicting here is an open war. The world has already moved ahead in technology and the future war is likely to be a cyber war or a hidden war. These types of wars cannot be predicted by above study. (Broadberry 2018) Bibliography "],

If answer to any of these questions is yes then we have a good news for you. StockTrend is innovative analytics tool that helps you answer exactly these kind of questions for any stock listed on NYSE or NSDAQ. No more blind shots into stock market. Use StockTrend and make an informed decision about your financial wellbeing. Stock price cycles through ups and down but many times it shows some interesting pattern with respect to Time. Time can be looked at from different granularities e.g. hour of the day the trade was booked to see if say afternoon deals are less profitable vs. morning deals? or may be if we look at yearly time and try to figure out if any particular month favors the trade profitability? StockTrend helps you identify all such hidden relations by going through millions of combinations of time slices per stock for decades of price movements and dishes out extremely digestible report of stock price analysis on multiple Time metrics to help you make right money making choice. 2.2 Our secret recipe StockTrend scans through thousands of stocks listed and traded on popular US stock exchanges NYSE (“NYSE Exchange Proprietary Market Data Real-Time” 2018) and NASDAQ (“NASDAQ RSS Feeds” 2018). We go through years and years of stock prices, trade volumes, lot sizes and lots of other trading information. Then we also source market events like - Fed rate changes - Dividends - Bankruptcy We also maintain external events like - Presidential election - Crude oil price shifts - Natural calamities like hurricane or cyclone - Wars - Government imposed sanctions on particular country/sector/company. Then we munch this humongous data and summarize at different layers using our proprietary algorithms to find patterns and useful stock base prices to helps our customers make informed financial decision. Our models are based on Box-Jenkins method (“Box–Jenkins Method” 2016) which is pioneer in analyzing time-series data. Using this method as base we have developed world class algorithms that run deep dive analytics to unearth astonishing patterns. Let me give you some of the simplified analytics that run under the hood. Gather stock price for a company over the period of say couple of decades and calculate Average stock price during each time slice of the day (9:30 am to 4pm split into 30 mins interval slices) vs. Daily average This metric when analyzed over period of time can generally show if specific stock shows tendency to open high/low and then stay flat or taper down during the day e.g. Usually this kind of behavior is shown by stocks affected by their offshore activities where the breaking news arrives before US wakes up so stock usually fluctuates early in the morning and then stabilizes. Average stock price during each time slice of the Month vs. Monthly average There are multiple ways in which we slice a month. One way is to slice a month by week. This metric shows if a particular stock moves during specific week of the month. e.g. Usually a stock having lot of derivative position fluctuates more in last week of the month when derivatives settlement happen. So this metric is useful in such highly leveraged stocks. Average stock price during each time slice of the year vs. Yearly average Again here there are multiple ways you can slice an year. Most popular slice is a quarter, where lots of stocks show tendency to be ‘price high’ on a particular quarter of every year. e.g. Some consumer product and ecommerce stocks show high prices in Jan-March quarter due to high sales volume during year end shopping spree. Average stock price just before presidential election vs. 1 year after election This is usually interesting metric and we can typically see that if one candidate is overwhelming leading the presidential election race then stock market is relatively calm but if there is uncertainty then our metrics can definitely help you calm down by guessing how market might behave during presidential election. These are some of the very basic and most popular metrics inside StockTrend. Then there are more complex and proprietary metrics that combine multiple factors by heuristically determined weights and connecting the events to predict more accurate stock price moves. To give you an example of one of our interesting findings - if ecommerce stock prices do well around Christmas then they also perform better relative to market around coming Valentine’s day. We have a theory on why this happens but we will let you guess :) 2.3 Get it now We are not yet another trading tips tool. StockTrend does not generate trading tips. We don’t sell any financial product either and we never will. If you are interested in a particular stock and if in need of some deep dive analysis of that stock to understand the intricacies and patterns shown by that particular stock then you are at the right place. StockTrend calculates hundreds of complex metrics for each of the thousands of stocks for each day, each week, each month, each quarter, each year for decades of stock data from two US stock exchanges, combines it with external events and makes it available to you at on demand so that you can breath easy when you press that buy or sell button.
