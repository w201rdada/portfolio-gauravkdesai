## Who would want to predict the next War Zone

History of human kind is filled with conflicts and wars that have grown from mere fights between two homo-sepian groups to full blown multi nation world wars. Each year billions of dollors are spent in maintaining peace and keeping the borders safe. Global bodies like United Nations were formed to maintain internation peace. Hence it is imperative that we study the historical conflict zones and predict the possible conflict zones for future so that we can be prepared to dissolve the risk of war as early as possible. This insight would certainly help countries plan their defence budget and strategy. It will also help organizations like UN to work more effectively than ever before.

## How can we predict next War Zone

We can analyse the past conflicts between nations and look at the parameters like
Economic conditions like GDP, debt, FX, export/import of each country vs wartimes
Local government stability/popularity/majority, whether democratic or autocratic, government's militery spends
Population growth, crime rates within country, gun imports into the country
Geography of country - costal, surrounded by more number of countries
Test whether similar conditions yeilded a war in pre UN era vs post UN era to test the efffectiveness of UN

All these studies cound help us look at the future and predict the future war zones

## Conclusion

Having a strong correlation to some combination of above parameters with war zone prediction we can successfully interven into potential conflict or atleast be well prepared for eventuality.
Also this analysis will test the usfulness of UN and similar organization and whether it makes sense to continue with such organization in their current form and shape.
